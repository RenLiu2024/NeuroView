# Interactive Study of EEG and Visual Communication: Quantitative Analysis of Emotional and Cognitive Responses

This repository contains the code and data for the study titled **"Interactive Study of EEG and Visual Communication: Quantitative Analysis of Emotional and Cognitive Responses."** The study explores the integration of EEG signals with advanced computational models to decode emotional and cognitive responses elicited by visual stimuli, providing a transformative approach to studying emotional and cognitive processes.

## Overview
Visual communication plays a pivotal role in understanding emotional and cognitive processes. Traditional methods relying on external behavioral or self-reported metrics often fail to capture the nuanced interplay between neural activity and visual perception. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes:

1. **Spatio-Temporal Visual Communication Network (STVC-Net)**: A novel framework combining spatial and temporal feature extraction with dynamic encoding-decoding mechanisms.
2. **Dynamic Contextual Adaptation Strategy (DCAS)**: A strategy that dynamically reweights features, refines iterative alignment, and employs multi-scale domain alignment to enhance adaptability.

### Key Contributions
- **Enhanced Precision**: The proposed framework achieves higher precision in decoding emotional and cognitive signals.
- **Robustness**: Improved robustness against visual noise and contextual variability.
- **Transformative Approach**: Integration of EEG and visual analysis offers a novel way to derive measurable insights from complex psychological data.
